# cub3

Sumo robot powered by LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3.

The main behaviour of the robot is to advance turning left and right in search for the opponent using the infrared distance sensor, and, when it finds it, moves full steam ahead.

When any of the light sensors detects a big change of ground colour (edge of the ring), the behaviour is overridden to move away from the ring.
